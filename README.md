Fun fact: `npx create-next-app@latest .` means that the app will be created in the current directory.

Everything backend will be in the api folder. The users folder will be an API once we have the route.ts file, the name cannot be changed.

If we have a folder with parentheses (auth) this will be ignored in the URL on the backend and frontend.

If we have a folder with square brackets [category] this will be dynamic.

# Notes

The `users.ts` file will be a database model that is stored in MongoDB. Our DB name is defined in db.ts and is called `nextrestapi`.
